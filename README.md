EventLister
===========

3dsmax sdk .net events and callbacks sample.

shows usage of GlobalInterface.Instance.RegisterNotification and Global.ISceneEventManager.RegisterCallback

result of my trial and error procedure due to lack of documentation

forks and improvements are welcome


Usage
=====

- clone repo
- open in visual studio 
- check references to Autodesk.Max.dll and UiViewModels.dll (they are in 3dsmax root folder)
- compile and copy EventsListControl.dll to C:\Program Files\Autodesk\3ds Max 2015\bin\assemblies\
- you'll find it under ..sdk tools Category in Customize User Interface in 3dsmax
